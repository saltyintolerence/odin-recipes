<h1>Jerk chicken</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>jerk chicken, a spicy grilled-meat dish mostly associated with Jamaica but common throughout the Caribbean. Jerk
    refers to a style of cooking in which the main ingredient—which most often is chicken but may also be beef, pork,
    goat, boar, seafood, or vegetables—is coated in spices and slow-cooked over a fire or grill traditionally composed
    of green pimento wood positioned over burning coals; the resulting smoke is key to the flavour of the dish. </p>

<p>In Jamaica, jerk chicken is famous for its pungent marinade, marked by allspice and Scotch bonnet peppers, which are
    similar to habanero chili peppers. (Holes are usually poked into the meat to enable the marinade to spread.) Common
    side dishes include rice, beans, plantains, sweet potatoes, and small cornbread fritters called festival.</p>
